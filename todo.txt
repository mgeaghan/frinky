Add in search function.

Can query using the following URL format:
https://frinkiac.com/api/search?q=kill+anyone+who+looks+at+me+cockeyed

Can grab a specific episode and timestamp with:
https://frinkiac.com/api/caption?e=S01E06&t=105256

The results of grabbing a specific timepoint will give the current frame with timepoints for captions, as well as the previous three and the next three frames. This will be useful for making an animation.

There's a *possibility* of adding a colour option.
In bash, you would do something like this:

RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Colour
echo -e "I ${RED}love${NC} Stack Overflow"

Possible colours in bash:

Black        0;30     Dark Gray     1;30
Red          0;31     Light Red     1;31
Green        0;32     Light Green   1;32
Brown/Orange 0;33     Yellow        1;33
Blue         0;34     Light Blue    1;34
Purple       0;35     Light Purple  1;35
Cyan         0;36     Light Cyan    1;36
Light Gray   0;37     White         1;37

I would need to work out how to translate that to python.
